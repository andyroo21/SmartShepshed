# SmartShepshed
Project - Smart ShepshedJanuary 20, 2018
OVERVIEW
1.	Project Scope
The main aim of this project is to provide real time weather data for the area of Shepshed.  The data will be obtained by an Arduino based node network and displayed via a website and historical data stored for future analysis.
The idea came from various projects of a similar nature that are happening in larger cities.  The reason for this project is to gather metrological data of our microclimate and what effects it has on the town.  The data collected will be used by the population of Shepshed, institutions and businesses. The project will be solely funded by Andrew Grimley initially, but there may be need for outside funding for further development of the network. Further development would include design and manufacturing of bespoke PCB/controllers specifically for Smart Shepshed, the research and implementation of more precise sensors and more sensor nodes installed.
The project is due to start January 2018.
The project will be advertised by social media and local media/news outlets.
